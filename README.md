## Installation (locally)

Follow instructions from https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html#setting-up-development-environment
but instead of creating repo via cookiecutter (TOP 3) you have to clone it. Afterwards, you don't have to `git init` the repo (TOP 4), as you cloned it already.
